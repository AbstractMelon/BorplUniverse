### Eeping Time System Guide

**Overview:**
The eeping system is a timekeeping method that simplifies traditional calendar structures by using a base-10 system. It replaces conventional dates with units that reflect a more streamlined approach to measuring time.

**Units of Measurement:**
- **Orp:** Equivalent to 1 year (e.g., orp 0 begins on September 27, 2024).
- **Yeep:** Equivalent to 1 month (10 yorps = 1 yeep).
- **Yorp:** Equivalent to 1 day (10 yeeps = 1 orp).
- **Eep:** A unit of time representing the overall count of time since orp 0.

**Structure:**
- **1 Orp = 10 Yeeps**
- **1 Yeep = 10 Yorps**
- **1 Yorp = 10 Eeps**

**Current Date Example:**
- As of September 27, 2024, the date is expressed as:
  - **Eep 0, Yorp 0, Yeep 0** or **0;0;0**

**Conversion from Old Time:**
- To convert traditional dates to the eeping system:
  1. Identify the difference in months and days from the base date (orp 0).
  2. Calculate the corresponding values in eep, yorp, and yeep.

**Future Events Example:**
- **Christmas (December 25, 2024):**
  - Old date: December 25, 2024
  - Eeping date: **Eep 0, Yorp 0, Yeep 3**

**Celebrations and Events:**
- Cultural events can be designated by specific eep, yorp, and yeep values, allowing for consistent annual observances without confusion.
- Traditions can be adapted to fit the eeping framework, ensuring that celebrations remain meaningful.
